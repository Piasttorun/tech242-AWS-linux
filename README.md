1 ===================================
Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and use computing resources (such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence) over the internet (the cloud) instead of owning and maintaining their own physical infrastructure. In other words, it enables users to leverage computing services on a pay-as-you-go basis, providing flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

Here's a simple diagram to help explain the basic concept of cloud computing:
